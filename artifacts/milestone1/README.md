## Promise-to-evidence map

| Milestone 1 promise | Evidence in this repo | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Real `verify_all_proofs.py` run artifact | `verify_all_proofs_report.txt`; generated `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` | Complete: 20/20 runtimes passed |

| WASM verifier build or artifact | `wasm_verifier_build_report.md`, `wasm_verifier_build.log`, `zk_lora_wasm_verifier.wasm` | Complete; WASM artifact committed |
| Proof generation and verification timing | `benchmark_report.md`, `benchmark_report.txt`, `run_proof_benchmark_raw.txt` | Complete for local Windows reference benchmark |
| 3-node gateway hardware layout | `docs/milestone1_hardware_layout.md` | Complete as implementation layout and capture checklist |
| Raspberry Pi/RAK photo or packet-forwarder log | `raspberry_pi_rak_setup_report.md`, `rak_operator_log_summary.md` | Application logs present; packet-forwarder/photo capture pending |

## Scope

This artifact pack proves that the Milestone 1 reference implementation builds and runs across the local toolchain and that the native C++ and WASM verifier artifacts are reproducible. The proof code is a structural Groth16-style reference prototype. Production ZK proof generation using gnark, arkworks, halo2, or Zcash circuit code remains future work as described in the updated whitepaper roadmap.
